    # About
    I am a PhD student at Jagiellonian University and a member of the LangUsta (Psychology of Language and Bilingualism) lab in Kraków, Poland. My research focuses on language processing in multilinguals with a particular interest in how they apply language control and domain-general cognitive control. Specifically, I explore whether the there is a relationship between the control processes and the level of proximity in a language pair. In my free time, I engage in various EdTech projects.
