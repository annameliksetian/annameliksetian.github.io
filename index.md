## About  
I am a PhD student at Jagiellonian University and a member of the [LangUsta (Psychology of Language and Bilingualism) lab](https://langusta.psychologia.uj.edu.pl) in Kraków, Poland. My research focuses on language processing in multilinguals with a particular interest in how they apply language control and domain-general cognitive control. Specifically, I explore whether there is a relationship between the control processes and the level of proximity in a language pair. In my free time, I engage in various EdTech projects.

## Research projects

**PI: Language and cognitive control in migrant populations: a study on Ukrainian-Polish bilinguals** (Oct 2024 - present). 

In a collaborative project with the Bilingualism, Mind, and Brain Lab, I investigate the language control and cognitive control indices in migrant populations. I am responsible for the assessment of a migrant group that speaks languages of high proximity: Ukrainian population residing in Poland.

*Affiliation: Jagiellonian University, Cracow, Poland*

**PI: Exploring language proximity and magnitude of language control during multilingual language production** (Oct 2021 - present). 

In my PhD project, I investigate the relationship between language proximity and language control in bilinguals. I aim to compare the magnitude of language control and domain-general cognitive control indices in several bilingual groups that speak languages with varying degrees of language proximity.

*Scientific advisor: prof. dr Zofia Wodniecka*  
*Affiliation: Jagiellonian University, Cracow, Poland*

**PI: Vocabulary learning strategies in acquiring an artificial language grammatically similar to Polish** (Sept 2020 - July 2021). 

I compared the effectiveness of vocabulary learning strategies when learning a language similar to one's native. Participants - native Ukrainian speakers - had to learn the vocabulary of an artificial language similar to Polish. The word association strategy showed the highest effectiveness in vocabulary learning.

*Scientific advisor: prof. dr Zofia Wodniecka*  
*Affiliation: Jagiellonian University, Cracow, Poland*

**PI: Strategies of word search and recognition in native Japanese, Chinese and Russian bilinguals** (Sept 2017 - June 2019). 

During my graduate studies, I explored the strategies of word search and recognition utilized by the Russian, Japanese and Chinese native speakers with varying level of language proficiency in English. The registration of eye-movement patterns revealed the association of the unique features of strategies with the group differences in the native language writing system, the level of English proficiency, and the language background.

*Scientific advisor: dr Irina Blinnikova*  
*Affiliation: Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia*

**RA: How language experience impacts cognitive control** (Mar 2018 - July 2018). 

I participated in the implementation of the research project "How language experience impacts cognitive control" supported by a grant awarded to Penn State University, USA, and Polish National Science Center, Poland. I performed the duties of a research assistant and interacted with the study participants during the experimental sessions.

*Affiliation: Jagiellonian University, Cracow, Poland*

**PI: Structural features of children's narratives and their connection to dialectic thinking in senior preschoolers** (Sept 2013 - June 2017). 

During my undergraduate studies, I explored the children's narratives created with the help of a visual model and identified their main structural features. I then attempted to draw connections between the structural features in a child narrative and their stage of the dialectic thinking development.
